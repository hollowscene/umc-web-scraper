Processing the Unfortunate Maps Catalogue.

Currently averaging about 3s to process each map.
Have additionally added a pause in between each map which can be adjusted.

Note that Google Sheets API has a limit of 100 write requests per 100 seconds per user
and 500 write requests per 100 seconds.

Please do not increase the rate beyond this limit.


This code sucks, plenty of optimisations for someone better at coding.


This will download json/png files to whereever the code is (these are very small files dont worry).
But just remember to clear them whenever you need to. Feel free to delete these files after they have been processed. 
Maybe in the future I will add functionality that automatically clears it although probably less likely for errors if just delete them manually


Contact me via discord for a key if you would like to help process.
